						 		<p>Ankita Joshi</p>
						 		<p>Co-Founder and Co-Director</p>
						 	</h4> 
						 	<p>Ankita is currently studying Bioengineering and Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley. She is a co-founder and director of the Girltank Chapter at Berkeley. She is also an undergraduate researcher at a qb3 laboratory at Cal that focuses on the development of single-molecule manipulation and detection instruments. Ankita has always loved science and learning about new technology. After growing up in India and being intensively involved in Model United Nations in high school, she became passionate about engineering for the developing world. During her first year at Cal, Ankita served as a design lead for Engineering World Health’s Cell Phone Project building a spirometer that can be run on smartphones. It was during this project that she realized the importance of social accountability in engineering design. This experience has encouraged her to expand her technical engineering education to include issues of social justice. Ankita is also a proud member of Edge Interns and Engineering Scholar as Engaged Scholar’s Program at UC Berkeley. She has a diploma in Kathak (a form of Indian Classical Dance), and enjoys drawing and painting in her spare time.</p>

						 		<p>Alison Long</p>
						 		<p>Co-Founder and Co-Director</p>
						 	</h4> 
						 	<p> Alison Long is an undergraduate bioengineering major at UC Berkeley. She is a current member of the Berkeley M3B lab, designing and testing 3D printed microfluidic devices such as transistors, capacitors, and diodes. She is also the Events Planning Director of Portraits of Kindness, a UC Berkeley organization that works with the Memory Project and students of all majors to create portraits of orphans around the world. Alison enjoys sharing her scientific interest through mentorship, and is a member of the Berkeley Bioengineering Honor Society and the Abbott Vascular STEM outreach team. Although a bioengineering major, Alison is passionate about art and design and has worked as an illustrator, designing the Women Engineers logo for Abbott Vascular and constructing the cover art and layout of the science fiction novel Rifts.  Alison would ultimately like to synthesize her love of art and science through work in the Biomedical Devices or Tissue Engineering fields. </p>

						 		<p>Joel Jacobs</p>
						 		<p>Webmaster, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Ambassador, Research and Content Development</p>
						 	</h4> 
						 	<p>Joel Jacobs is a sophomore Electrical Engineering and Computer Science major and Global Poverty and Practice minor from Seattle, Washington. Joel is a firm believer in the power of innovation and technology to achieve social justice and empower people. He discovered his interest in computer science during his sophomore year of high school, and is drawn to engineering because it revolves around creating tangible, testable, and usable solutions to real-world problems. His long-term goal is to make the benefits of computer technology that many take for granted, including access to improved communication, information, education, and free speech, more widely available. Through SEE, Joel hopes to give back to the campus that inspired him by making it easier for others to discover, experience, and get involved with the social power of engineering.</p>

						 		<p>Anuja Godbole</p>
						 		<p> Chemical Engineering Ambassador, Research and Content Development</p>
						 	</h4> 
						 	<p> Anuja Godbole is a second year Chemical Engineering major at UC Berkeley. Growing up in India, she witnessed the lack of justice and adequate technology, which motivated her to join SEE because of its mission to encourage social change through engineering. She enjoys volunteering in the summers at organizations like the SOS Children’s Villages of India for disadvantaged children. In the past, she has worked at the National Chemistry Laboratory in Pune, India on a project to develop basic laboratory safety and technique booklets for underprivileged schools in the area. Anuja developed an interest in chemical engineering after working on an analytical project on ethanol production from biomass last year, and after interning for BioUrja Trading LLC, a private company in Houston this past summer. She was also fascinated by the applications of chemical engineering through her work on a project to test for carcinogens in cosmetic products last semester. While Anuja is very passionate and excited about engineering, she would eventually like to go to law school to study energy or environmental law.</p>

						 		<p>Alyssa Yu</p>
						 		<p>Civil Engineering Ambassador, Rsearch and Content Development</p>
						 	</h4> 
						 	<p>Alyssa Yu is an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, studying Civil Engineering with an intended emphasis in either structural or environmental engineering. She first developed an interest for engineering in her high school physics class, and after doing mission work in Nicaragua in the summer of 2012, she realized that she wanted to integrate technical skills with her dedication to social justice and hopefully affect change in global development. Alyssa had her first experience with socially engaged engineering last spring, working directly with residents in central California to perform water quality testing and filter management in prevention of nitrate contamination due to agricultural runoff. She is currently a member of Engineers for a Sustainable World, working with Project Rishi to develop a clean water drinking system for villages in rural India. Alyssa is also on the Site Planning committee for Berkeley Project, a student-run event at Cal that encourages and organizes thousands of students to help serve various parts of the surrounding Berkeley community. In her free time, she enjoys taking pictures and hopes to one day use photography as another tool in raising awareness of social inequity and calling people to action.</p>
